# 📐 Exhibition Stall Material Descriptions
📝 Overview
This repository contains Material Description Documents created for multiple exhibition stall projects. These documents serve as a technical reference for vendors and fabrication teams, clearly outlining the materials, finishes, lighting elements, furnitures, and structures shown in the approved 3D layouts.

Each file translates design intent into execution-ready specifications, ensuring accuracy during fabrication, procurement, and on-site setup.
